<ins>**Security Comes First:**</ins> <br/>
I take security seriously and have implemented a 3 stage system that seperates the Database from the API and the UI's.<br/>
Everyone is welcome to test pentest the software so long as the intent is non-malicous and all bugs are reported.

&nbsp;

## Build:
* Start MySQL locally or use the provided docker compose file by running `docker compose up`

* Create a database called `safeaccountsapi_db`.

* Use `SafeAccountsAPI/TableCreations_MySQL.sql` to build the tables and set relationships.

* Now that your database is setup, update the connection string in `SafeAccountsAPI/appsettings.development.json`. In case the docker-compose.yml is being used remember to update the password in the  connection string .

* Finally, run the api. You will see that 5 new users have been added as well as some accounts and folders.

## REST API Endpoints

To test the admin functionality, modify the role of one of the default users directly in the database.

Also, all inputs and outputs are in json format of course. <br />
Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and use SafeAccountsAPI.postman_collection.json to easily test the API's endpoints.
